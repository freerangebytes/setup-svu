## Why Use This Action?

- **Multi-architecture support** – Automatically detects and downloads the correct binary for your runner's architecture (x86, x64, ARM, ARM64)
- **Immutable releases** – Downloads directly from [svu's official GitHub releases](https://github.com/caarlos0/svu/releases), ensuring you get authentic, unmodified binaries
- **Version pinning** – Specify exact versions for reproducible CI builds, avoiding unexpected changes from floating tags
- **Lightweight and focused** – Does one thing well: installs svu and gets out of your way
